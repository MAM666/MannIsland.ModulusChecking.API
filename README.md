# MannIsland.ModulusChecking.API
MannIsland Modulus checking HTTP API

HTTP API for checking the validation of a sortcode and accountnumber
The standard/double modulus checking with exception 4 & 7 implemented too.
The modulus weight table is included as an embedded resource for now. 
Though I would actually just have the text file accessed straight from the web folder instead so any changes dont cause a rebuild.
